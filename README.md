# ruby_on_rails_application_for_genomic_trait_analysis_genome
This repository contains a complete ruby on rails application for the development and analysis of genomic traits for the sequenced genomes and how it can be deployed for the machine learning. It uses sqlite3 and postgresql as a backhand and uses bootstrap for the custom appearance. The app can be extended to any genomic trait modelling and can be deployed for the large scale application by the integration of the other applications.
